Artemis Financial Practices for Secure Software Report

Client Summary: The client for this assignment was Artemis Financial, a company that wanted to increase the security of their software. In particular, they wanted to close security loopholes in the application through secure data communication, integrity, and confidentiality, especially for sensitive financial data.

Important Challenge: The company needed assistance with the identification of software security vulnerability and mitigation thereof, particularly related to data encryption, secure communications, and management of dependencies across the software stack.

Achievement in Mitigation of Software Security Vulnerabilities: I successfully identified critical vulnerabilities of the application using various security practices, such as employing AES encryption and SHA-256 hashing to ensure data integrity, substituting the communication protocol from HTTP to HTTPS, and employing dependency scans to identify vulnerable third-party libraries. All these measures ensured protection of sensitive data and ensured industry-standard security in the application.

Importance of Secure Coding: Secure coding is important to prevent data breaches, tampering, and unauthorized access. Secure coding guidelines ensure sensitive information is protected, the risk of security breaches is reduced, and the trust of the clients and users is maintained. Secure coding was most important for Artemis Financial to keep financial data secure and avoid financial or reputational loss through security vulnerabilities.

Value of Software Security: Software security has immense value through the safeguard of company assets, prevention of data theft, preservation of client trust, and compliance with legal and industry regulation. For Artemis Financial, this would translate into greater client confidence, minimal risk of financial loss, and competitive edge in the financial services industry.

Challenging and Helpful Aspects of the Vulnerability Test: A helpful aspect of the test was using the OWASP Dependency Check tool to identify third-party dependency vulnerabilities. This allowed for the identification of potential security vulnerabilities ahead of time. The most difficult aspect was having appropriate secure communication protocol implementation and ensuring no vulnerability was introduced after refactoring the code.

Adding Layers of Security: To add layers of security, I implemented AES encryption (AES-GCM mode) for data protection, added SHA-256 hashing for data integrity, and utilized HTTPS for safe communication. In the future, I would run tools like OWASP Dependency Check and static analysis to identify vulnerabilities, and then prioritize mitigation based on severity and exploitability of the issues identified.

Ensuring Safe and Properly Functioning Code: After the code was refactored to eliminate vulnerabilities, I performed functional testing and used tools like the OWASP Dependency Check to verify if new vulnerabilities were added or not. Code reviews and static analysis on a regular basis would be the critical methods for constant improvement and testing.

Resources, Tools, and Practices for Future Tasks: The tools and practices used in this task, such as OWASP Dependency Check, SHA-256 hashing, and AES encryption, will be extremely useful for future tasks. These tools help to catch vulnerabilities early, and the practices of secure communication (HTTPS) and dependency management will help to keep software projects robust and secure.

Future Example Employers: Future employers will be presented with examples of how I have effectively used secure encryption protocols (AES-GCM) in financial applications, utilized SHA-256 for data integrity, and utilized industry standard security practices such as dependency management and HTTPS encryption. These are critical skills that show my ability to secure applications and avoid vulnerabilities.
